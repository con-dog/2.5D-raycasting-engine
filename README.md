# A 2.5D Raycasting Game Engine

## Currently in Phase 4:

![Phase 4 Preview](https://github.com/con-dog/2.5D-raycasting-engine/blob/1401433f57d4c0c732b924adf9c13507f07d32c8/_media/phase-4/phase-4.gif)

- Levels are represented in memory as Jagged Arrays (to save memory)
- Wall and Floor maps are just CSV's (So I can quickly make levels in Excel)
- Wall and Floor textures are represented by char's so I can very quickly make maps with a variety of textures
- Wall/Floor file io

## Previous phases
### Phase 3
- Fixed visual artifacts and pixel densities

### Phase 2
- Wall collision detection
- Basic texture mapping for walls
- Very warped tetures with many artifacts

### Phase 1
- Very basic ray-casting
- No collision detection
